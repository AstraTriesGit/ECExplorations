# ECExplorations
Signals and Systems by Haykin and Van Veen (2nd Ed.) and most ECE-related textbooks have Matlab code examples to facilitate learning.
Here lies the Julia equivalent of the code examples, without proper indexing, really. Maybe it expands into an actual full-fledged project
that finds some practical use (which is not an active goal, mind you!)
